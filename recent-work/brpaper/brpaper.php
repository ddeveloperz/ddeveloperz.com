                            The sexy portions of most sites are the front-end, consumer-facing pages, but this site had two distinct audiences: stylists throughout the world who were vying to be recognized for their talents and the internal team at Revlon that would be judging the contest.
                        We put as much work into making the control panel for the judges as easy to use as the homepage, knowing that the majority of the use was actually happening in areas that only users with passwords would see. There were details in every aspect of the site, from the way it was architected to the pixels that displayed on screen, that needed the polish typically reserved for a siteâ€™s homepage</p>
